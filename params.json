{"name":"BiSON.js","body":"Bandwidth optimized binary encoding for JavaScript \r\n==================================================\r\n\r\n**BiSON** provides a JSON like encoding for JavaScript objects but focusses\r\non providing a format that is optimized for use with WebSockets and other \r\napplications where bandwidth is a major concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe Library exports a `encode` and a `decode` method on either the global `BISON` \r\nobject in the Browser or on the module when used under Node.js.\r\n\r\n    // Encoding and decoding a Object\r\n    BISON.decode(BISON.encode({ key: 'value' })) // { key: 'value' }\r\n\r\n\r\n# Pro and Contra \r\n\r\nBiSON **saves** between **30 to 55 percent** of size when compared to **JSON**. \r\nWith the average saving being around **45 percent**.\r\nIn order to achieve a maximum of compression BiSON makes some trade offs, \r\ntherefore it is not 100% compatible with JSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Encoding Limits\r\n\r\n- Floats are single precision\r\n- Integers are limited to 32 bits\r\n\r\n> **Important:** For reasons of speed, **BiSON** does **not** perform any \r\n> validation on the data you pass it.  \r\n> *E.g:* Passing Numbers that are not within the valid range will result \r\n> in invalid  output and result in infinite loops in the worst case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Speed\r\n\r\nOnly half as fast as recent *native* JSON implementations, but that's still \r\nfast enough, you want to send as little data over the network anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nThe tests can be run with `nodeunit` or in a browser of your choice.\r\n\r\n# The Format\r\n\r\n**BiSON** converts all values into a bit stream in order to achieve maximum \r\ncompression of the different data types, the format is described below.\r\n\r\nEach `value` is prefixed by a `3 bit` field that determines its `type`:\r\n\r\n- `0`: \r\n    Either a `Boolean`,  `null` or `EOS`, a `2 bit` field with the following \r\n    values follows:\r\n\r\n\t- `0` = `false` \r\n\t- `1` = `true` \r\n\t- `2` = `null` \r\n\t- `3` = End of Stream\r\n\r\n- `1`: \r\n    A `Integer` in the range of `-2147483648` to `+2147483648`, a `3 bit` field\r\n    follows that contains the number of bits that make up the actual value:\r\n\r\n\t- `0` = `1 bit` \r\n\t- `1` = `4 bits` \r\n\t- `2` = `8 bits` \r\n\t- `3` = `12 bits` \r\n\t- `4` = `16 bits` \r\n\t- `5` = `20 bits` \r\n\t- `6` = `24 bits` \r\n\t- `7` = `32 bits` \r\n\r\n    After the above number of bits, a `1 bit` field follows containing the `sign`.\r\n\r\n- `2`:\r\n    A single percision `Float`, same data as the `Integer` but with an additional\r\n    `4 bit` field at the end containing the number of decimal places the value needs\r\n    to be shifted to the right.\r\n\r\n- `3`:\r\n    A `String`, a `3 bit` field with the following values:\r\n\r\n\t- `<= 28` = The length in bytes.\r\n\t- `   29` = A `8 bit` field follows containing the length in bytes.\r\n\t- `   30` = A `16 bit` field follows containing the length in bytes.\r\n\t- `   31` = A `32 bit` field follows containing the length in bytes.\r\n\r\n    The stream is padded to the next full **byte** followed by the raw string data.\r\n\r\n- `4`:\r\n    Start of an `Array`, all values until the next `type #6` are to be \r\n    appended to this array.\r\n\r\n- `5`:\r\n    Start of an `Object`. Pairs of `String` and a value follow, until the next \r\n    `type #6`.\r\n\r\n    The string is to be used as the key in the object to which the value will be \r\n    associated with.\r\n\r\n- `6`:\r\n    End of the last opened `Array` or `Object`.\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n**BiSON** is licensed under MIT.","tagline":"Bandwidth optimized binary encoding for JavaScript ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
